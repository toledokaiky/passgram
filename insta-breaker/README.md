# Insta-Breaker

Insta-Breaker is a tool designed for automated login attempts on Instagram using a username and a file containing multiple passwords. It is intended for ethical use only, such as testing the security of your own Instagram account.

## Features

- Automated login attempts on Instagram
- Supports providing passwords from a file
- Includes built-in checks and prompts for a smoother user experience

## Installation

To use Insta-Breaker, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The tool relies on `inpass` for handling the login attempts.


### INSTALLATION

pkg update

git clone https://github.com/GH05T-HUNTER5/insta-breaker
```

cd insta-breaker
```
```bash
bash install.sh
```
```bash
insta-breaker
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Instagram username and the path to your password file. Ensure the path is correct, and the file exists.
